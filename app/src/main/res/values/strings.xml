                        The goal of this app is to work with dataBinding
                        and scrollview. \n\n This is a scrollable view but I have no idea about what I should write
                        in here in order to look smart. \n\n I am a master\'s degree student at University of Pernambuco.
                        I am 27 years old and most of the time I just coded for fun. \n  I have experience in Android (Kotlin and Java) and my goal after learning
                        android is to learn React Native and code for both Android and iOS. \n\n My hobbies are playing soccer, jogging on the beach and investments. \n\n
                        I also like teaching people things I know. \n\n I started coding in Android in 2019 in a school project and developed a
                        QRcode reader application connected to Firebase Database in order to monitor classroom in order to better control the start and end of the classes as well as
                        professors\' presence and regularity.</string>
